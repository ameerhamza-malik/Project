Optimal Image preprocessing on “The ISIC 2020 Challenge Dataset” for Skin Lesion

Analysis Towards Melanoma(Cancer) Detection using OpenCL

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to provide hands-on experience with parallel and
distributed computing using OpenCL by converting a dataset of colored images of skin lesions
into greyscale images.
The ISIC 2020 Challenge Dataset:
The ISIC dataset is vital for dermatology and medical image analysis, providing a diverse
collection of high-quality skin lesion images. It supports the development of diagnostic
systems, segmentation algorithms, and deep learning models for automated lesion detection
and classification. By aiding early skin cancer detection and diagnosis, the dataset significantly
improves patient outcomes globally. Its accessibility and breadth make it indispensable for
advancing research in dermatology, oncology, and medical imaging.
Converting the ISIC dataset to greyscale images simplifies image representation, aiding
analysis and processing such as lesion segmentation See Figure 1. Grayscale conversion
reduces complexity by removing color information, enhancing computational efficiency and
facilitating tasks like lesion detection.

The dataset contains dermoscopic training images of unique benign and malignant skin
lesions from over 2,000 patients. Each image is associated with one of these individuals using
a unique patient identifier. For this assignment you are only required to use the Test Set
available at containing 10,982 JPEG images of different sizes:

Problem Description:
You are provided with a dataset of colored images of skin lesions in various JPEG format. The
task is to convert these colored images to grayscale images using OpenCL parallel
computing.

Greyscale conversion involves transforming each pixel of the image from its RGB (Red,
Green, Blue) representation to a single intensity value representing the luminance.
Instructions:
The detailed requirements are mentioned in the sections provided below:
Setup Environment:
Install necessary OpenCL SDK and drivers on your machine. Installation instructions
and tutorial was already provided to you on GCR. Ensure that you have access to a GPU that
supports OpenCL for optimal performance.
Dataset Preparation:
Download the metnioed dataset of colored images of skin lesions. Familiarise yourself
with the dataset structure and image formats. For simplification only the JPEG format is
selected.
OpenCL Implementation:
Write OpenCL kernels to perform the conversion of colored images to grayscale
images. Ensure that your kernels can handle images of varying sizes. Implement efficient
memory allocation and data transfer strategies for optimal performance.
Image Processing:
Load each colored image from the dataset into memory. Apply the OpenCL kernel to
convert the colored image to greyscale. Save the resulting greyscale images to the disk.
Documentation:
Prepare a brief report documenting your implementation approach, including:
● Description of host program, including configuration steps and strategy to handle
complete dataset.
● Description of the greyscale conversion algorithms used and the thresholds selected
for greyscale value assignment. Along with the explanation of the OpenCL kernel
design.
● Also, Include five (5) random images from the original dataset of colored images along
with the generated grayscale images.
Submission Guidelines:
Submit the Zip Archive including,
1. Your implementation code, including the Host Code (C language), OpenCL
Kernal Code.
2. Documentation report in PDF format.

Note:
1. Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Ensure that your implementation is original and
properly cited if referencing external resources.
2. Understanding the assignment is also part of the assignment. You may make any
assumption as long as it does not contradict with the provided instructions.
3. Late submission will not be accepted.

Evaluation Criteria:
● Correctness of the greyscale conversion and implementations.
● Clarity of the documentation report.
This assignment aims to provide you with practical experience of OpenCL using a very simple
real-world image processing task.

Good luck!
